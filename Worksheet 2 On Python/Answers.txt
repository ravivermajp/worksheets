Ans11) Differece between List, Tuples, Sets and Dictionary are:

List - list are mutable it can be changed after creation and also list cannot be used as key in dictionary because dictionary itself are immutable.

Tuples - tuples are immutable it cannot be changed after creation but it can be used in dictionary as tuples and dictionary both are immutable.

Sets - A set is a collection of unique keys. it is similar to dictionary but it only holds single value not like Key:Value Pair.

Dictionary - A dictionary is a collection of key:Value pair. it is mutable and have unordered collection. where as list and tuples are ordered collection of items.

Ans12) Strings are immutable.

abc = "I+Love+Python"
result = abc.replace("+", " ")
print(result)

Ans13) Function ord() gives the unicode of a character. it only takes a string length of 1. it converts string to number.

Example:
a = ord("a")
print(a)

type() function is used for getting datatype of a variable.

Example: type("FlipRobo")
