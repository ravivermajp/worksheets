Ans 12.) Large learning rate allows the model to learn faster but they may converge too quickly and if we use small learning rate allow the model to learn a more optimal but it may take longer to train or may get stuck at process.
Ans 13.) for three inputs the number of combinations of 0 and 1 is 8. For four inputs the number of combinations of 0 and 1 is 16. For five inputs the number of combinations of 0 and 1 is 32. The formula that computes the number of binary input patterns for a given number of inputs is 2^n where n is power of 2 and n is the number of inputs in neuron.
Ans 15.) batch is the complete dataset. where iterations is the number of passes the algorithm has done on the dataset. Epochs is the number of times a learning algorithm sees the complete dataset.
